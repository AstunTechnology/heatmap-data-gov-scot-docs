        Accessibility Statement for https://heatmap.data.gov.uk/

Accessibility
================

This website is hosted and maintained by <a href="https://www.astuntechnology.com/">Astun Technology Ltd</a> on behalf of the [Scottish Government](https://www.gov.scot/). We want the Scotland Heat Map interactive site to be accessible and usable for as many people as possible.

The interactive map layers use colour to display data in a meaningful manner. We have thought carefully about our colour choices and have tried to ensure that the colours are distinguishable for all users, including those with colour blindness. To generate graduated colour scales for raster (grid) and polygon layers, we used an online colour palette generating tool, [Chroma.js Color Palette Helper](https://gka.github.io/palettes). In our scales, the darker the colour, the higher the value for the grid square or polygon. We also used this tool to choose contrasting colours for the heat networks point layer.

The energy supply layer uses a set of icons specially designed for the Scotland Heat Map. We have not used a tool to generate their colours and some users may be unable to distinguish between them. However, as well as colour, the icons show a simplified image representing each technology type which allows them to be distinguished without relying on colour alone.

How accessible this website is
------------------------------
We know some parts of this website are not fully accessible:

- Not all non-text content is available in text form, for example not all images have “alt” attributes. However, with the exception of the layers contained within the geothermal and mining group, users are able to click on a feature (point, polygon, grid square) of interest in the map to display information on that feature based on the layers selected in the layer panel.
- Not all content can be rendered using assistive technology (for example: screen readers cannot navigate interactive maps).
- It is not possible to navigate all aspects of the website using keyboard alone.
- Some elements, such as links, are distinguishable only by colour.
- Individual browser and display settings (for example, zoom level) may affect how the map displays and prints.
